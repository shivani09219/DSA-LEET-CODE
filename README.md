This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems categorized by topic and difficulty level. The goal of this repository is to improve my problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

#Two sum
This solution solves the classic Two Sum problem, where the goal is to find two indices in an array whose values add up to a given target. It uses a HashMap to store elements while iterating through the array, checking if the complement of the current element exists in the map. This approach ensures optimal performance with a single pass through the array.
Time Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array
Space Complexity: O(n) — for storing elements in the HashMap
